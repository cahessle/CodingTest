# CodingTest

Implemented Features:
1. list view of user data & photos
2. clicking on a list item opens a new screen displaying additional user data
3. clicking on the phone number opens the dialer
4. clicking on geolocation opens map view centered on the provided coordinates

map view
I used the geo latitude & longitude since the addresses are fake
Most of these locations are in the ocean or Antartica so I configured the map to zoom all the way out

Libraries: retrofit & picasso
